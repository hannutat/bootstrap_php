A website of an imaginary clothes store. It is a study assignment made using Bootstrap v5 / PHP.


The website is built using components from Bootstrap examples. The ready made components are all customized for use in this website, and a little bit of own CSS is used on the side. The website is responsive and can be viewed with any device. There is a simple functioning cart system and some other parts that are made with PHP. It is possible to add products to cart and remove them. The products filtering is also done with PHP. The checkout, login and register buttons do not do anything but launch a modal window with a message.
